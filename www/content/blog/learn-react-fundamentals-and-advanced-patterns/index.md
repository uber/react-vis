This course is for [React](https://reactjs.org) newbies and those looking to get
a better understanding of React fundamentals. With a focus on React
fundamentals, you'll come out of this course knowing what problems React can
solve for you and how it goes about solving those problems. You will have a good
grasp on what JSX is and how it translates to regular JavaScript function calls
and objects.

Each lesson in this course is just a single `index.html` file which will help
you **keep your focus on learning React and not distracted by all the tools that
make production applications work.** The course wraps up with a lesson on how to
move from these `index.html` files to a more production ready development
environment and even how to deploy your app to a great service like
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

The goal of this course is to give you the knowledge of advanced patterns you
can use to make React components that are more flexible, simpler, and more fun
to build, use, and maintain. We'll start with a simple `<Toggle />` component
which we'll progressively refactor to each of the patterns so you can see the
relative trade-offs of the patterns and how they can be used together to
increase the usefulness of your component while at the same time simplifying
things for everyone.

Having built and shipped components using each of these patterns, I'll help you
understand and weigh the tradeoffs of each of them and you'll come to
intuitively know where to apply each pattern in your own components. When you're
finished with this course, hopefully you'll have a list of actionable things you
can do to rework the components that you're building to make them more flexible,
simpler, and more fun to build, use, and maintain.
