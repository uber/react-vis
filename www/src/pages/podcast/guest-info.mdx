# You're a guest! Yay!

This is awesome. I'm super excited to have you on the podcast. I know you're
busy, so I'll keep this brief and you can feel free to ping me if you have any
questions, cool? Cool. So here's the info you need to know to prepare for our
podcast recording.

1. It's a 30 minute long podcast
2. It's really chill. No need to study up ahead of time
3. It's audio only
4. We use Zencastr to connect/record.
   [Here's a short intro to Zencastr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcCJkiDeh0g)
   (you don't need to install anything).
5. Try to be somewhere quiet
6. When we're done, please stay on the page until Zencastr finishes uploading
   your audio (the `mp3` backup uploads quickly, but the `wav` takes some time).
7. Please review the code of conduct below

> Zencastr does not support video and that's not required for our podcast,
> however I find it's kinda nice to see the person I'm talking with so if you're
> interested, I will share a link to a [Zoom](https://zoom.us) call for video
> (we'll still use Zencastr for audio).

# Key Takeaways

The podcast is conversations between me and my esteemed guest (that's you). Even
though it's my podcast, this episode is _your_ show. I've invited you on the
show because **I feel like you have a message that I want to share with the
audience.** Before the recording starts, we can talk about what _you_ want that
message to be and we'll decide together on the key takeaways we want people to
have when they finish listening.

In general, my goal is that when people finish listening to the show they are
motivated, inspired, and encouraged to do something to improve themselves
(whether that be personally or professionally).
